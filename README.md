# OpenID4VC Proof of Concept

> [!NOTE]
> Please be aware that this repository serves as example and not as reference code

This proof of concept serves as a SSI-Showcase with OID4VC with a small set of features (as an MVP) for Verifiable Credentials with SD-JWT as authentication mechanism between issuers & base registry to gain insights about the technologies. After that initial phase of learning the product will be gradually expanded. The main objective is to verify assumptions, gain knowledge and experience with the product and its acceptance within the target audience.

## Project Context

6.5 million people in Switzerland have a driving licence and 600'000 licences are being issued each year. asa (Association des services des automobiles/Vereinigung der Strassenverkehrsämter) wants to introduce a digital driving licence and digital vehicle registration documents in the future.

In a first step [asa](https://asa.ch/) onboards a small group of drivers - the learning drivers - in Appenzell Ausserrhoden. As soon as this group passes the theoretical exam, they will get a digital proof called eLFA (*e*lektronischer *L*ern*F*ahr*A*usweis). With this digital driving licence, they are allowed to drive a car accompanied by another driver. This proof is stored in a mobile application (wallet, link to [Android](https://github.com/e-id-admin/eidch-pilot-android-wallet) and [iOS Repo](https://github.com/e-id-admin/eidch-pilot-android-wallet)). The police and driving instructors are trained to be able to verify the digital driving licence.

The E-ID Program is setup due to new [regulation for electronic identity](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/fga/2023/2843/de). In order to develop a trust infrastructure based on new technologies, several pilots have been launched - one of which is the eLFA.


## System Overview

Issuers are identified / authenticated according to the private / public key they hold. Updates to the registry are done using Verifiable Credentials.

Revocation registry is split off from base registry, to allow different optimizations.

In this case, should the identification and authorization of the issuer to update the revocation registry continue to be done using the existing public / private key as for signing JWTs.

## Project Setup

### Install general dependencies
> The package requirements written below are **ubuntu specific**  and may not necessarily have an direct equivalent in other distributions
The follwing dependencies need to be installed before running the project, to assure compability:
- docker >= 24.0.7
- python >= 3.11.7
- python3.11-dev
- python3.11-venv
- libpq-dev
- jq
- postgresql
- build-essential

**Install command**

``` bash
sudo apt install jq postgresql build-essential libpq-dev python3.11-dev python3.11-venv -y
```

**Check docker group assignment**   
The setup script needs to be run as a non-root user. Check wether the current user is actually in the docker group, to run docker as a non-root user
```bash
> $ groups
<group 1> <group 2> docker
```
### Setup environment
To initially setup the environment, there is the follwing convenience script. Be aware that the initial run might **take up to 5 minutes**
````bash
bash setup_environment.sh
````
When the run was successfull the output should look like this:

```bash
 => [verifier run  9/12] COPY ./verifier/ verifier                                                                                                   0.8s
 => [verifier run 10/12] COPY ./common/ common/                                                                                                      0.4s

```
Now that the python venv has been built, you have to activate it
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### How to use in local development mode

1. execute setup_environment.sh
    * This performs the onboarding in your docker compose environment
1. docker compose up 
1. navigate to https://localhost:8000/docs for issuer
1. check /health/ for problems
    * metadata needs to be set via /oid4vc/admin/metadata 
    * first time status list must be initialized by issuer with /admin/status-list

### While coding
When there is an incoming change, you might need to reset the environment based on the severity of the changes

### Rebuild the containers
``` bash
docker compose build
```
or
``` bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```
### Reset the environment
Changes affecting cryptographical parts might require to delete additional generated folders. This can be achieved by running the following convenience script
```bash
bash reset_environment.sh
```

## Implementation details

### Credential Status
Credentials are tracked using a management id. Together with the management id, a state is provided. This diagram shows an overview of the states and the possible transitions.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    OFFERED
    IN_PROGRESS
    EXPIRED
    ISSUED
    SUSPENDED
    REVOKED
    [*] --> OFFERED
    IN_PROGRESS --> OFFERED: reset (support)
    IN_PROGRESS --> ISSUED: issue credential (delete vc data)
    IN_PROGRESS --> EXPIRED: validity posix timestamp exceeded
    OFFERED --> REVOKED: revoke offer
    OFFERED --> IN_PROGRESS: Redeem token
    OFFERED --> EXPIRED: validity posix timestamp exceeded
    ISSUED --> SUSPENDED: suspend
    SUSPENDED --> ISSUED: unsuspend
    ISSUED --> REVOKED: revoke
    SUSPENDED --> REVOKED: revoke
```

### Logging

Logs are sent to stdout using the logging module provided by python.

The log level can be set using an environment variable "LOG_LEVEL". To identify the application, the environment variable "APP_NAME" needs to be set.

### Database Versioning
Database Versioning is done with Alembic.
To create a new version use the command `alembic revision`
eg:
```alembic revision -m "<comment>" --rev-id <major>.<minor>```
