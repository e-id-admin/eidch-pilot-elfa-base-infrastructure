# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Incoming security reports will be taken seriously and checked on a regular basis. If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please report it with the "Report a vulnerability"-form in the "Security" tab.

The project team will then acknowledge, analyze and respond to your report accordingly.
Please do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities until they have been analyzed and a fix is available.

Thank you for helping us to make our project more secure.
